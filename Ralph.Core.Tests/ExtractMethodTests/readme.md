ExtractMethodTests contains tests specific to CSharpMethodExtractor.

The section to be extracted is delimited by /* BEGIN */ and /* END */ tags.

The result of that extraction should be a perfect match of the method 
named 'Expected'.

I don't think extracting methods is a good way to prepare expessions and 
statements for subsequent pattern application. This stuff is likely on it's 
way out.
